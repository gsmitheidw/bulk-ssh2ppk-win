# bulk-ssh2ppk-win

Bulk Convert OpenSSH private keys into Putty's PPK format in Powershell

Convert openssh keys into ppk putty keys
Requires recent version of WinSCP, specifically winscp.com not winscp.exe
puttygen on Windows does not have the command line functionality of puttygen on Linux

ssh-keygen can convert putty public keys apparently but I haven't tried this
and I needed to convert already generated private openssh keys to ppk.
